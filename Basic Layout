Level 1: Find 5-10 playing cards for an old man and sort them using insertion sort.
Level 2: Find 4 Keys and match them with keyholes using Stable matching algorithm.
Level 3: Sort a set of piano keys to make a complete note.
Level 4: Shortest path algorithm?
Level 5: A big Empty room with a big holographic crystal instde. To go through the crystal have to be transformed. The task is to
         find out the 9 components of transformation matrix:
         (i) Travel through previous layers to find individual components.
         (ii) Individual components will be in the form [a,0,0] or [0,b,0] or [0,0,c].
         (iii)  Added together they will form the vector [a,b,c].
         (iv) After finding each tripple, they have to be added (with vector addition ritual).
         (v) So which one's are related to which, should be given in the instruction in the crystal.
# As there are 9 components, may be additional 5-6 levels have to be designed to make 9-10 levels.
# Together with travelling to old levels it will make up total 20 levels!
# May be there will be a small one level tutorial teaching basic algorithms and acquainting people with vector.
# Vectors will be represented as movements or arrows representing movements.
# Can a 2d game handle this much complexity?
# A game must include human things. So the algorithms must be wrapped with human things like:
    1) Finding lost loved ones - the central motive for the game?
    2) Fighting enemies. Will it be too tough to animate?
# What kind of world will it be?

To Do:
1. List the algorithms:
    So far listed: Insertion sort, stable matching, merge sort, shortest path, travelling salesman algorithm for L 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
2. Take inspiration from Puzzle and adventure mix genere games (like Limbo). As this will best be one such game.
3. The story can take inspiration from Shade 3. Really good animation is a big part of that game. We'll only focus on how story
   involves us in the hunch of unravelling mystery.
